# HESS_results

This directory contains the classification results of X-ray sources within the extent of unidentified HESS sources with detection significance S/N>6 (signif_6) and S/N>3 (signif_3) together  with some additional data products (e.g., source class visualization on top of X-ray images). 

For each subdirectory, it contains a summary website of all classifications (HESS.html) and only confident classifications (HESS_conf.html) where the classification of each X-ray source with some of its important multi-wavelength properties are saved in the HESS_class_MW_signif_3.csv for signif_3 subdirectory and HESS_class_MW_signif_6.csv for signif_6 subdirectory. An interactive plotting of the X-ray image with the X-ray sources with S/N>3 and S/N>6 and their classification results is saved as the {HESS_name}.html for each HESS field under the corresponding subdirectory.
